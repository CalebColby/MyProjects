	<p class="Text">
		Prior to attending Neumont, I went to Charter School called American Preparatory Academy for High School. I had a lot
		of fun doing musicals in High School. It was still High School of course and so it sucked in plenty of other ways but
		the Musicals were very fun regardless. While I was there I preformed in shows such as Music Man, Beauty & the Beast,
		A Comedy of Errors, The Hobbit Puppet Show, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, and many others
